Hi! Welcome to my personal web page, my name is Daniel and I am a computer engineer. I consider myself a persistent person in learning new disciplines and very applied at work, someone who pays close attention to detail, and passionate about computer science and technology. Specifically, I have a preference for programming and information technologies. It is important to invest in yourself, that is why I believe we should keep learning skills that differenciate us from others. I often develop projects and applications in my free time, you can find some of them in my GitHub profile.

I am currently looking for a job and open to listen any offer, even if they are not near my area. Someday, I desire to move to another city or even live abroad, since I think both life and work are an experience and each ingredient is in a place.
